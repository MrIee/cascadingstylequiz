##<a name="about"></a>About
Cascading Style Quiz is a project I created to test/demonstrate the concept of a web-app that presents the user with a series of css based tests. Each tests consists of an element on the right side of the screen that has been pre "styled" and the users mission, should they choose it accept it, is to enter in the appropriate css to style their element on the left side to be identical to the on the right.

* Entering all of the css on one line renders the users element properly but doesn't get validated.
